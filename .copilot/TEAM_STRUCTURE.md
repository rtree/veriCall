## Working Process

1. **Issue Reported** → Manager acknowledges and assigns
2. **Investigation** → Researcher gathers logs and evidence
3. **Planning** → Planner creates implementation strategy
4. **Implementation** → Worker executes the plan
5. **Review** → All team members verify the fix
6. **Deployment** → Manager approves GO

## Communication Style

- Each team member speaks from their perspective
- Decisions are made collaboratively but Manager has final say
